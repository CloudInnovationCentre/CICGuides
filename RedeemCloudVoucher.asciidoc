== Step 2:
We strongly suggest you to create a distinct account to host your Amazon subscription. This will allow you to more easily share your subscription with other members of your organisation.

Create an account using the _“Sign up now”_ link.

== Advice
When setting up your Voucher, you will be given the option to set an _"Alert"_ when your account balance falls below a particular level. We suggest setting up an alert at £250. You will receive an email to a designated email account.

== Backups and Disaster recovery
It is important to maintain your own backups. This includes all source code or datasets. If you would like guidance on how to prepare off-side backups, please contact a CIC representative and we will be happy to advise you.

== Overview
You have now redeemed your CIC voucher, and will be able to make use of a full range of Microsoft Azure services.

For further details or assistance, please do not hesitate to contact your CIC representative.
